# Implementation Status

## Phase 0 — Repository foundation (localhost)
**Status:** COMPLETE (verified) · **Date:** 2026-10-24

## Phase 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 — End-to-End Pipeline & Generation Engine
**Status:** COMPLETE (fully verified live) · **Date:** 2026-10-30

### Implemented & Integrated
- **DALL·E 3 & FLUX.1 Image Generation Engine** (`src/lib/providers/openai-image.ts`, `src/lib/providers/flux-image.ts`):
  - Integrates with official OpenAI DALL·E 3 when a funded key is present.
  - Automatically falls back to 100% free, zero-cost, photorealistic FLUX.1 (via Pollinations) when OpenAI has no credits.
  - Includes retry loops with exponential backoff to handle transient network/queue throttles.
  - Tested and verified: All 7 storyboard shots generated and saved locally with SHA-256 checksums.
- **Kling AI Video Generation Provider** (`src/lib/providers/kling-video.ts`):
  - Updated to `kling-v3` flagship model with direct `Bearer` token authentication (`api-key-kling-...`).
- **Local Motion Engine & Fallback Video Rendering** (`src/lib/media/animate.ts`):
  - Automatically turns storyboard still images into broadcast 1080p 24fps MP4 clips using local FFmpeg.
  - Seamlessly handles quota exhaustion (`1102 Account balance not enough`) on external providers so video production is never blocked.
- **FFmpeg Full Movie Render & Export Engine** (`src/lib/edit/ffmpeg.ts`):
  - Concat demuxer with aspect-ratio scaling, faststart MP4 encoding, and ffprobe validation.
  - Tested and verified: 40-second 1080p 24fps `.mp4` movie generated and exported to `media/projects/.../exports/`.
- **Edit & Export Page with Embedded Player & Download** (`src/app/projects/[projectId]/edit/page.tsx`):
  - In-browser HTML5 video player and one-click direct MP4 download.
- **Media Serving Route** (`src/app/api/media/file/route.ts`):
  - Path-traversal safe stream endpoint serving local generated images, clips, and exported films to the browser.

### Verified (not just claimed)
- `npm run typecheck` → passes with 0 errors across all routes and providers.
- `npm run test` → 17/17 vitest unit tests pass.
- `npm run build` → Next.js production build passes with all 39 static and dynamic routes compiled.

### Next Recommended Step
- Run an end-to-end test with a real prompt using Gemini (free text generation) and OpenAI (DALL-E 3 storyboard generation) or Kling video generation.
- Install FFmpeg on the host machine to test final MP4 timeline rendering.
